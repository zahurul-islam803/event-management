#### Answer: B .

<i>Write your explanation here</i>
The reason the answer is "B" is because a function called sayHi has been declared. In which a props called name is sent. And "Hi there, and that name" is printed as return. No value is given when calling the function. Again, the default value of the props is not given, so the props named "name" did not get any value, so the console did "Hi there, undefined".
